With the aid of transformers, significant progress has been achieved in hyperspectral image change detection (HSI-CD) in recent times. Nonetheless, most contemporary detection methods fail to incorporate diverse diagnostic features extracted from hyperspectral (HS) images. In addition, relying solely on algebraic-based techniques to extract information of difference is insufficient for achieving satisfactory detection performance. In this regard, we propose an innovative triple-path local-to-global network (TL2GN), complemented by a hybrid head transformer (HybridHT), called TL2GH2T, tailored for HSI-CD tasks. To be specific, TL2GH2T first investigates spatial, spectral, and spatial–spectral features from a local-to-global perspective. Then, a novel spatial and spectral token fusion (SSTF) module is developed to integrate the above three tokenized features, producing discriminative features from two HS images separately. Moreover, drawing inspiration from chromosomal crossover mechanisms, we propose a HybridHT. Its goal is to simultaneously learn cross correlation and self-correlation information of bitemporal features from a global perspective, producing highly discriminative distinctions. Our approach, validated through extensive experimentation on four varied HS benchmarks, exhibits exceptional performance in HSI-CD, outperforming contemporary methods in both visual and quantitative evaluations.
