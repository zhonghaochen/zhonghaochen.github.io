Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) has received considerable attention in the field of target detection due to its powerful ability to capture the spectral information of land covers, and plenty of detection algorithms have been explored. However, these methods generally leverage the difference between the spectrum of the target to be detected and the background spectrum to accomplish target detection, and so are susceptible to the problem of spectral variability. In this article, we propose a global to local hierarchical detection algorithm for HSI (G2LHTD). First, extended morphological attribute profile (EMAP) is first used to model global spatial texture information from HSI. Subsequently, a diverse-direction constrained energy minimization ( D2 CEM) detector is developed to consider the spatial information within eight neighborhoods around each pixel in HSI, yielding comprehensive local spatial information. More substantially, to effectively discriminate the neighborhood information in diverse directions, we devise an adaptive neighborhood feature aggregation (ANFA) strategy, which will comprehensively evaluate the significance of neighborhood information in diverse directions. As a result, the spatial features of HSI can be comprehensively considered for hyperspectral target detection (HTD). Extensive experiments, conducted on four standard datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The codes of this work will be available at https://github.com/zhonghaochen/G2LHTD_Master for the sake of reproducibility.
