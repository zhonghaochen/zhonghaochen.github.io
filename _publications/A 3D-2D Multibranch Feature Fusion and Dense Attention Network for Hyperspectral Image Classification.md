Abstract: In recent years, hyperspectral image classification (HSI) has attracted considerable attention. Various methods based on convolution neural networks have achieved outstanding classification results. However, most of them exited the defects of underutilization of spectral-spatial features, redundant information, and convergence difficulty. To address these problems, a novel 3D-2D multibranch feature fusion and dense attention network are proposed for HSI classification. Specifically, the 3D multibranch feature fusion module integrates multiple receptive fields in spatial and spectral dimensions to obtain shallow features. Then, a 2D densely connected attention module consists of densely connected layers and spatial-channel attention block. The former is used to alleviate the gradient vanishing and enhance the feature reuse during the training process. The latter emphasizes meaningful features and suppresses the interfering information along the two principal dimensions: channel and spatial axes. The experimental results on four benchmark hyperspectral images datasets demonstrate that the model can effectively improve the classification performance with great robustness.
